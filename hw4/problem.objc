# This file contains the object calculus problems that you must implement
# for part one of the homework.

# The first portion of the homework assignment centers around boolean
# values and their encoding on the object calculus. The encoding we will
# use is similar to the one in the lambda calculus. Intuitively, a boolean
# is an object that selects one of two methods to invoke, whether it is
# true or not. The definition of true and false is provided below.
# We define booleans to be objects with 3 fields: ontrue, onfalse and eval.
# ontrue and onfalse are fields to be overridden by users of the boolean,
# who invoke eval on the boolean to select the true or false value.
true = [eval = \o. o.ontrue, ontrue = \o.o, onfalse = \o.o];
false = [eval = \o. o.onfalse, ontrue = \o.o, onfalse = \o.o];


# Problem 1: Implement the boolean not operator. This is defined through a not-er
# object that has a user-defined field b, the boolean to negate, and a field eval,
# which returns the resulting negation of b.
noter = [
  eval = \n. [
    eval = \o. ((n.b.ontrue <- \d. o.onfalse).onfalse <- \d. o.ontrue).eval,
    ontrue = \o.o,
    onfalse = \o.o
  ],
  b = \o.o
];

# Problem 2: Implement the boolean and operator. Similarly to above, this is defined
# through an and-er object that takes the and of the two user-defined fields b1 and b2.
ander = [
  eval = \a. [
    eval = \o. ((((a.b1.ontrue <- \d. a.b2.ontrue).eval).ontrue <- \d. o.ontrue).onfalse <- \d. o.onfalse).eval,
    ontrue = \o.o,
    onfalse = \o.o
  ],
  b1 = \o.o,
  b2 = \o.o
];

# The second portion of the homework assignment is focused on an encoding
# of the natural numbers in the object calculus. This encoding is different
# than the church encoding used the SKI and lambda calculi. Rather than
# representing a number n as n applications of a function f, the object
# calculus encoding represents a number n as an object where n selections
# of the field pred can be applied before the field iszero returns true.
# Concretely, a natural number n is encoded by an object with at least three
# fields: iszero (returns whether or not n is zero), pred (returns n - 1)
# and succ (returns n + 1). The encoding of zero is defined below, along
# with using zero to obtain 1, 2, and 3.
zero = [
  iszero = \o. true,
  pred = \o. o,
  succ = \o. ((o.iszero <- \o. false).pred <- \x.o)
];
one = zero.succ;
two = one.succ;

# As an example of the above encoding, the expressions below should evaluate to
# the corresponding values. They are currently commented out.
# zero.iszero;          # [eval = \o.(o.ontrue), ...]
# one.iszero;           # [eval = \o.(o.onfalse), ...]
# one.pred.iszero;      # [eval = \o.(o.ontrue), ...]
# two.pred.pred.iszero; # [eval = \o.(o.ontrue), ...]

# Problem 3: Implement addition between natural numbers encoded in the object
# calculus. This is done through an adder object that adds the user defined fields
# n1 and n2 together.
adder = [
  eval = \a. ([
    iszero = \o. ((ander.b1 <- \d. o.n1.iszero).b2 <- \d. o.n2.iszero).eval,
    pred = \o. ((o.n1.iszero.ontrue <- \d. (o.n2 <- \d . o.n2.pred)).onfalse <- \d. (o.n1 <- \d . o.n1.pred)).eval,
    succ = \o. o.n1 <- \d. o.n1.succ,
    n1 = \o. a.n1,
    n2 = \o. a.n2,
