error[E0382]: use of moved value: `syned`

   |             ----- move occurs because `syned` has type `Syned`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait

   |                                   --------------------- `syned` moved due to this method call

   |             ^^^^^ value used here after move

note: `Syned::send_ack` takes ownership of the receiver `self`, which moves `syned`
